# Welcome
Hello there, welcome to the personal website of Jiayi(Helen) Zhou! I am a first-year MS student in the Epidemiology Department at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. I graduated this May from the University of Connecticut. During my undergraduate, I have majored in biology and been interested in studying human diseases, especially cancer research. Epidemiological studies came into my sight because it approaches human diseases from upstream levels, shedding light on a promising future that all human diseases could be better understood and controlled. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, epidemiology has come into the spotlight, and more and more people start to realize how important public health is. I am grateful to have this opportunity to further my education at Mailman to learn more about public health at this perfect timing.
