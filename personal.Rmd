I am an international student from Beijing, China. My given name is Jiayi, while you are welcome to call me Helen. This English name has been with me since Kindergarten. I came to the state four years ago for my undergraduate study, and it has been an amazing adventure for me.

In my free time, I love to cover songs. Here is my insta account where I randomly post my covers and share my life. Please feel free to browse through:
